## Uploading Sketch
To assemble this system gather the materials mentioned in Requirements and Materials.

### Follow these steps to upload the code to Arduino Mega 2560:




## Usage
Before turning on the the system create a hotspot or connect to any access point(*Note*:- Change the credentials accordingly in the code of ESP8266 Wifi shield before uploading to it.). Now Turn ON the system by providing a 9V to 12V power supply.
